**Contributor queue:** 72 PRs waiting on assignment; the oldest has waited 36 days, and 22 have waited more than a week.

**Needs a maintainer's judgment:**

- whether to assign an external contributor, which reopens their gated PR
- merging, and marking agent-opened draft PRs ready
- changes to documented behavior or compatibility, and any API addition
- cutting a release, and its title and notes
- classifying and disclosing security reports

States: `ok` last run succeeded; `idle` nothing to do in the window; `degraded` last run failed; `off` disabled.
